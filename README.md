# Nice to (re-)Meet You!

## a Chrome extension to remove pesky article reading limits by clearing local storage on a per-site basis

## Background
I wrote "Nice to (re-)Meet You!" because my software engineering school would ocassionally ask us to refer to resources on sites like realpython.com, which would throw up an un-closeable popup insisting that I had read too many articles for a guy without an account.

These messages would pop up even if I had simply read the same article multiple times! 

So, I put together a simple extension for Google Chrome to make those pop-ups go away.
